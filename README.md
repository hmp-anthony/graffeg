To build :
`make`

all the executables are in the 'build/src'

I implemented this code bit-by-bit while reading through "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", and the follow up articles.

See here: `https://raytracing.github.io/`

After finishing the tutorial I hope to augment the functionality of the code.

The first improvement is that we have separate executables for separate examples.
