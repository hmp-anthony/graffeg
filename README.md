I use CodeBlocks:

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake .. -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"`

I implemented this code bit-by-bit while reading through "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", and the follow up articles.

See here: `https://raytracing.github.io/`

I have made some improvements to the code:

1. separate executables for separate examples.
